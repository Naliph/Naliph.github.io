I'm trying to learn Jekyll here...
YEssss! got it

### Trying some equation:

$$ f(x) = e^x$$

### Trying some code text
`np.random.rand()`

block of code:

```python
def f(x):
    """
    A cool function that multiplies an input x by 2 
    ... lmao, ok not cool
    """
    return 2*x
```

```python
print("to boldly go")
```
to boldly go

### Trying Images

### Trying peer feedback
To indicate you learned something new: use `got-help` class:

{::options parse_block_htmn="true /}
<div class="got-help">
I learned something really cool from my peer feedback!
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

Use `gave-help` to indicate places in which the comments were able to improve the code of peers:

{::options parse_block_htmn="true /}
<div class="gave-help">
I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion or so.
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

Example of `get-help`:

{::options parse_block_htmn="true /}
<div class="got-help" markdown="1">

In my first draft of my code, I computed the logistic sigmoid function on a list of values using:
```python
import math
def sigmoid(X):
    return [1 / (1 + math.exp(-x)) for x in X]
```
One of my peer reviewers pointed out to me that my code would be faster on large data sets and be more compatable with scientific Python libraries if I assumed that the input and output were Numpy array.
```python
import numpy as np
def sigmoid(X):
    return 1/ (1 + np.exp(-X))
```
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
