title: Spectral Clustering
---

A tutorial on a simple version of the *spectral clustering* algorithm for clustering data points.

***Spectral clustering*** is an important tool to seprate distinc section of data sets with complex structure. It works best on irregular data sets that simple clustering tools like `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` cannot identify.

To better compare what happen with clustering complex structure without spectral clustering, let's look at an example where we use `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`, a simple clustering tool.

## Simple Clustering Example:


```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
n = 200
np.random.seed(1111)
X, y = datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, random_state=None, centers = 2, cluster_std = 2.0)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```

**Clustering** is an unsupervised learning problem. It refers to data analysis technique for discoviring patterns in data, organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way. 

There are many algorithm for clusterin. A very common way for clustering is using `KMeans`, which has good performance on circular-ish blobs like these: 


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)

plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```

![kmean-blobs.png](/images/spectral/kmean-blobs.png)
    


So for simple data blobs, `KMeans` clustering works fine. However, on a complex data structure, `KMeans` will perform badly. 


```python
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 200
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```


    
![crescents.png](/images/spectral/crescents.png)
    


The structure now are crescents rather than blobs. 
- Matrix `X` contains the Euclidean coordinates of the data points.
- Array `y` contains the labels of each point.

Since the irregular crescent structure, the simple circular clustering tool `KMeans` won't work:


```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```

    
![kmean-crescents.png](/images/spectral/kmean-crescents.png)
    

The graph above shows how badly `KMeans` performs on complex structure. For these situation, SPECTRAL CLUSTERING is a more appropriate tool.


# Spectral Clustering Tutorial


*NOTE:* The Euclidean coordinates of the data points are contained in the matrix `X`, while the labels of each point are contained in `y`. 
<br><br>

***Notation:***
- Boldface capital letters like $$\mathbf{A}$$ = matrices (2d arrays of numbers). 
- Boldface lowercase letters like $$\mathbf{v}$$ = vectors (1d arrays of numbers). 
- $$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$$ = matrix-matrix product (`A@B`). 
- $$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}$$ = matrix-vector product (`A@v`). 

#### The overall maths:
Let $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$$ be the $$i$$th row-sum of $$\mathbf{A}$$, which is also called the *degree* of $$i$$. <br>
Let $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ be two clusters of the data points. We assume that every data point is in either $$C_0$$ or $$C_1$$. 
The cluster membership as being specified by `y`. We think of `y[i]` as being the label of point `i`. So, if `y[i] = 1`, then point `i` (and therefore row $$i$$ of $$\mathbf{A}$$) is an element of cluster $$C_1$$.

$$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)\equiv \mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)}\right)\;.$$

In this expression, 

- $$\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0, j \in C_1} a_{ij}$$ is the *cut* of the clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$. 

- $$\mathbf{vol}(C_0) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0}d_i$$, where $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$$ is the *degree* of row $i$ (the total number of all other rows related to row $$i$$ through $$A$$). The *volume* of cluster $$C_0$$ is a measure of the size of the cluster. 


## *similarity matrix* $$\mathbf{A}$$
- $$\mathbf{A}$$ is a 2D `np.ndarray` matrix with shape `(n, n)` (`n` is the number of data points). 
- Entry `A[i,j]` should be equal to `1` if `X[i]` (the coordinates of data point `i`) is within distance `epsilon` of `X[j]` (the coordinates of data point `j`). 
- To get the distances, use `sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` on `X` coordinates. Also, set `epsilon = 0.4` in this part
- The diagonal entries `A[i,i]` equal to zero. Here we are using `np.fill_diagonal()` 

 


```python
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

# We have the Euclidean coordinate X, label y, with n = 200 above.
# Initiate our similarity matrix size nxn 
A = np.zeros((n,n)).astype(int)
epsilon = 0.4

# pairwise distances matrix from data X
distance_X = pairwise_distances(X)

# Entry A[i,j] = 1 if distance at corresponding distance_X is within epsilon
A[distance_X <= epsilon] = 1

# diagonal entries of A = 0
np.fill_diagonal(A,0)
```


```python
# Check similarity matrix A
A
```




    array([[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0],
           ...,
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0]])



Now we have a matrix that shows information of the pairwise distances between all points. label `1` means that the pairwise distance of the data points are close to each other within `epsilon` distance.


## Cut Ojective
The cut term $$\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)$$ is the number of nonzero entries in $$\mathbf{A}$$ that relate points in cluster $$C_0$$ to points in cluster $$C_1$$. 

A small cut objective means points in $$C_0$$ is usually far from points in $$C_1$$. 

`cut(A,y)` function compute the cut term by summing up the entries `A[i,j]` for each pair of points `(i,j)` in different clusters. 

* $$\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0, j \in C_1} a_{ij}$$ is the *cut* of the clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$. 


```python
def cut(A, y):
    # values in cluster 0:
    C0 = np.where(y == 0)[0]
    # values in cluster 1:
    C1 = np.where(y == 1)[0]

    # initiate sum for entries A[i,j] for each pair of points (i,j) in y
    cut_sum = 0
    for i in C0:
        for j in C1:
            cut_sum += A[i,j]
    # returns sum of points between 2 arrays associated to C0 and C1
    return cut_sum    
```

<br>

A reccomendation to make masks for clusters and iterating through each cluster values:
```python
C_0_values = np.where(y == 0)[0] 
C_1_values = np.where(y == 1)[0]
```
Rather than check if i and j in range n belong to different cluster or not:
```python
if y[i] != y[j]: cut_sum += A[i,j]
```
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}


To better understand the cut objective value. We are going to compute the cut term for the true clusters `y` vs. a random vector of random labels `y_random` of length `n` with each label equal to either 0 or 1. 


```python
cut(A,y)
```




    26




```python
# random vector of random labels of length n
y_random = np.random.randint(2, size=n)
cut(A,y_random)
```




    2320



The cut terms reflect total points that are close together but got cut off into different cluster. So, if vector y puts points in matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$ that are close together into different clusters, the cut term will increase. Our target is to minimize this cut terms to better distinguished between spectral clusters. 

`y_random` is randomly assigning labels to points in $$\mathbf{A}$$, resulting in very high cut number. Compare to this random set, the cut objective for the true labels of 26 is *much* smaller, indicating the cut term indeed favors the true clusters over the random ones.



## Volume Objective
The second factor in the binary norm cut objective: *volume term*. <br>
*Volume* of cluster measures how big the cluster is. <br>
If cluster $$C_0$$ is small, then $$\mathbf{vol}(C_0)$$ will be small and $$\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)}$$ will be large, leading to an undesirable higher objective value. 


Function `vols(A,y)` computes the volumes of $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$, returning them as a tuple. For example, `v0, v1 = vols(A,y)` should result in `v0` holding the volume of cluster `0` and `v1` holding the volume of cluster `1`. 

* $$\mathbf{vol}(C_0) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0}d_i$$, where $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$$ is the *degree* of row $$i$$ (the total number of all other rows related to row $$i$$ through $$A$$). The *volume* of cluster $$C_0$$ is a measure of the size of the cluster. 


```python
def vols(A,y):
    # vols C0 == 𝑖 th row-sum of 𝐀, y label 0, C1 label 1
    vol_C0 = A[y==0,:].sum()
    vol_C1 = A[y==1,:].sum()
    return (vol_C0, vol_C1)
```



## Binary Normcut Objective

The binary normcut objective purpose is to find clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ such that:

1. There are relatively few entries of $$\mathbf{A}$$ that join $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$. 
2. Neither $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ are too small. 


* Applying the formula:
$$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)\equiv \mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)}\right)\;$$




```python
def normcut(A,y):
    c = cut(A,y)
    v0, v1 = vols(A,y)
    return c * (1/v0 + 1/v1)
```

Compare the `normcut` objective using both the true labels `y` and the fake labels `y_random` generated above:


```python
print("true labels: ", normcut(A,y))
print("Random labels", normcut(A,y_random))
```

    true labels:  0.02303682466323045
    Random labels 2.0650268054241563
    

The normcut true label cluster is much smaller than the randomized label. Hence, y label of clusters $$C_0, C_1$$ is a good partition of data since $$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)$$ normcut metric is small.

## Alternative Expression for Normcut Objective
Define a new vector $$\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ whereL

$$
z_i = 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\ 
    -\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)} &\quad \text{if } y_i = 1 \\ 
\end{cases}
$$

The signs of  the elements of $$\mathbf{z}$$ contain information from $$\mathbf{y}$$: if $$i$$ is in cluster $$C_0$$, then $$y_i = 0$$ and $$z_i > 0$$. 

Then, proves that the normalized cut objective is the same as this equation:

$$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1) = 2\frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}}\;,$$

where $$\mathbf{D}$$ is the diagonal matrix with nonzero entries $$d_{ii} = d_i$$, and  where $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i$$ is the degree (row-sum) from before.  

*Tasks:*
* `transform(A,y)` function computes the appropriate $$\mathbf{z}$$ vector given `A` and `y`, using the formula above. 
* Check the equation above that relates the matrix product to the normcut objective, by computing each side separately and checking that they are equal. 
* Check the identity $$\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$, where $$\mathbb{1}$$ is the vector of `n` ones (i.e. `np.ones(n)`). This identity effectively says that $$\mathbf{z}$$ should contain roughly as many positive as negative entries. 


#### Transform(A,y)


```python
def transform(A,y):
    v0, v1 = vols(A,y)
    # using the formular for z, set all z values to 1/vol(C0) first
    z = np.full(n, 1/v0)
    
    # then seek out label y=1 and reset the value of z to -1/vol(C1)
    z[y==1] = -1/v1
    
    return z
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
The code `vols(A,y)` was told to be concise and helpful.
The `transform(A,y)` function, the use of `np.full` is said to be a clever way to set the size of the vector (no need to create an empty vector, then filled in for 1 and 0 separately).
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}


#### Check the normcut objective


```python
# compute D diagonal matrix with nonzero entries dii = di, di = row-sum
D = np.diag(A.sum(axis = 1))

z = transform(A,y)

# check both normcut objectives:
norm1 = normcut(A,y)
norm2 = 2 * (z@(D-A)@z) / (z@D@z)

norm1, norm2
```




    (0.02303682466323045, 0.023036824663230267)



Compare the 2 normcut computations by using `np.isclose(a,b)` (due to computer arithmetic limitation, the numbers are not exactly the same)



```python
np.isclose(norm1, norm2)
```




    True


#### Check the identity $$\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$


```python
z@D@np.ones(n), np.isclose(z@D@np.ones(n), 0)
```




    (-4.5102810375396984e-17, True)



This identity effectively proves that $$\mathbf{z}$$ contain roughly as many positive as negative entries. 

## Orthogonal Objective Optimization: `scipy.optimize.minimize` method
Since we have the alternative expression for constructing normalized cut objective, we can perform optimization normcut objective by minimizing the function:

$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

subject to the condition $$\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$. <br>


To embedded this condition, substituting $$\mathbf{z}$$ the orthogonal complement of $$\mathbf{z}$$ relative to $$\mathbf{D}\mathbf{1}$$. 

Referencing professor Philips Chodrow for the code below, with `orth_obj` function and using the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` to minimize the function `orth_obj` with respect to $$\mathbf{z}$$. 




```python
def orth(u, v):
    return (u @ v) / (v @ v)*v

e = np.ones(n) 

d = D @ e

def orth_obj(z):
    z_o = z - orth(z, d)
    return (z_o @ (D - A) @ z_o)/(z_o @ D @ z_o)
```


```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize
# minimize vector z_
z_min = minimize(orth_obj, z)
```


#### Visualize clusters
The `minimize()` function above gave an approximately optimizing for the normcut objective (*continuous relaxation* of the normcut problem), 

Due to the approximation, We gonna use `-0.0015` instead of 0 to differentiate between the negative and positive values (this is a trials and errors thing, -0.0015 works best out of all 0 approximation)


```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = z_min.x < -0.0015)
```

![crescent-cluster-zmin.png](/images/spectral/crescent-cluster-zmin.png))
    


Although close, but there are still mistakenly label data points for this optimization using `minimize()` method.

## Improved Objective Optimization: Eigenvectors method 
Rewind back to the function used for minimizing: 
$$ R_\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{z})\equiv \frac{\mathbf{z}^T (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{z}}{\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}} $$

with respect to $$\mathbf{z}$$, subject to the condition $$\mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$. 

According to the **Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem**,minimizing $$\mathbf{z}$$ is solved by finding the smallest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem 

$$ (\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{D}\mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbb{1} = 0$$

which is equivalent to the standard eigenvalue problem 

$$ \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}) \mathbf{z} = \lambda \mathbf{z}\;, \quad \mathbf{z}^T\mathbb{1} = 0\;.$$

Since $$\mathbb{1}$$ is actually the eigenvector with smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $$\mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})$$, the vector $$\mathbf{z}$$ that we want must be the eigenvector with  the *second*-smallest eigenvalue. 

*Tasks:*
* Construct the matrix $$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{D}^{-1}(\mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A})$$, which is often called the *Laplacian* matrix of the similarity matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$. 
* Find the eigenvector corresponding to its second-smallest eigenvalue, and call it `z_eig`. 
* plot the data again, using the sign of `z_eig` as the color.


```python
# construct Laplacian matrix
L = np.linalg.inv(D)@(D-A)

# eigenvalue and eigenvector
eigval, eigvec = np.linalg.eig(L)

# argsort eigenvector and correspond eigenvalue from smallest to largest
ix = eigval.argsort()
eigval, eigvec = eigval[ix], eigvec[:,ix]

# second-smallest correspond unit eigenvector
z_eig = eigvec[:,1]

# plot result
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = z_eig < 0)
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
Previously, I accidently use `(L+ L.T)/2` in `np.linalg.eig()`, a friendly peer pointed out that since the Laplacian matrix is already a nonsingular square matrix, we can directly find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using L itself.

The result plot is much better than the z_min method, although it is not perfect due to limit precision of minimization by default. 

# Compact function for Spectral Clustering Algorithm
A combination of everything we went throught so far, minusing the unsuccessful one and go straight out to the best algorithm only!

Function `spectral_clustering(X, epsilon)`, which takes in the input data `X`  and the distance threshold `epsilon` and performs spectral clustering, returning an array of binary labels indicating whether data point `i` is in group `0` or group `1`.

2. Construct the Laplacian matrix. 
3. Compute the eigenvector with second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. 
4. Return labels based on this eigenvector.

## Examples using `spectral_clustering` function

#### Experiment with `make_moons` datasets. Change `noise` setting:

The `noise` parameters often causes the algorithms to miss out patterns in the data, so here, we want to see how is this parameter will affects the accuracy of our spectral clustering algorithm

```python
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.1, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.4))
```

![crescent-spectral-cluster-noise1.png](/images/spectral/crescent-spectral-cluster-noise1.png)


```python

n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.3, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.7))
```

#### Experiment with `make_circles()` -- the bull's eye data set:



```python
n = 1000
X, y = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None, factor = 0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```

There are two concentric circles. As before k-means will not do well here at all. 


```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```


    
![kmean-bullseye.png](/images/spectral/kmean-bullseye.png)



```python
# apply the spectral_clustering() function
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.4))
```

![bullseye-spectral-cluster-40.png](/images/spectral/bullseye-spectral-cluster-40.png)
    



```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.33))
```
![bullseye-spectral-cluster-33.png](/images/spectral/bullseye-spectral-cluster-33.png)
    



```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.3))
```
![bullseye-spectral-cluster-30.png](/images/spectral/bullseye-spectral-cluster-30.png)



```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.5))
```

![bullseye-spectral-cluster-50.png](/images/spectral/bullseye-spectral-cluster-50.png)



```python
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = spectral_clustering(X, 0.53))
```

![bullseye-spectral-cluster-53.png](/images/spectral/bullseye-spectral-cluster-53.png)
    

So I tried multiple `epsilon` here, from 0.3 to 0.55, the best value is around 0.33 - 0.53. For epsilon 0.53, there is already mis-categorize data points. Going out of this range would cause the clustering failed completely.
